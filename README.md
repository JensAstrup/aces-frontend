## Notes
This is my first Next.js project, and I am still learning best practices as well as how I would
like to structure the project. All feedback is welcome, but bear in mind as you read the code that
I am still learning :) 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
